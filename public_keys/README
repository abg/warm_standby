public_keys/ is used as a scratch area for the warm_standby playbook to stage
the public ssh keys for the postgres user across each server involved in a
warm standby setup.  Each server's public key is added to the postgres
user's authorized_keys file to allow for bidireclty data transfer to allow
copying WAL and base backups from the primary to the secondary instances.
